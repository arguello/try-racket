<h3>Functions for Closing In</h3>
<h4>(Î»)</h4>
<p>Notice that the result was <font class="green">50</font> - exactly half of <code class="expr">lower</code> and <code class="expr">upper</code>. That's binary search in action.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined our <code>(guess)</code> function; we need to write the functions for <code>smaller</code> and <code>bigger</code>.
<p>Like <code>guess</code>, these functions are defined with the <code>define</code> form. Let's start with <code>smaller</code>:</p>
<p><pre><code class="expr">(define (smaller)
  (set! upper (max lower (sub1 (guess))))
  (guess))</code></pre></p>
<p>Like <code>(guess)</code>, we wrap the function name <code>smaller</code> in parens because it takes no parameters.</p>
<p>Second, the function body consists of two expressions, one per line.</p>
<p>Third, the function uses a <code>set!</code> expression to change the value of a variable.</p>
<p>The purpose of <code>set!</code>, pronounced <font class="red">set bang</font>, is to <em>evaluate</em> the expression and set the <em>variable</em> to the resulting value.</p>
<p>Go ahead and type: <code class="expr">bang bang</code></p>

  <span>the bang in <font class="red">set bang</font> refers to the exclamation mark: <strong>!</strong> The term has it's roots in comics, where <em>Bang</em> was usually emphasized by an exclamation mark. In computing, people prefer to say the short, cool sounding word <strong>bang!</strong> over the five-syllable phrase <em>exclamation mark</em>.</span>
