<p>That was easy, right?</p>
<p>Coding is often about breaking a task into small pieces, and putting those pieces together to form a program.</p>
<p>As you noticed, we listed the basic steps necessary for the <strong>Guess My Number</strong> game. We then defined the variables and functions to represent those steps.</p>
<p>Another thing that made this easy was our programming language of choice: <strong>Racket</strong></p>
<p>Racket is an immensely powerful language - we call it a multi-paradigm language because it supports multiple styles of computer programming.</p>
<p>It is also a <em>programmable programming language</em>, meaning you can customize it to your domain or preferred style.</p>
<p>At the same time, Racket was designed in a way that makes programming fun and easy to learn.</p>
